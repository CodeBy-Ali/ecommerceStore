## Features

### Frontend
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly design with **Sass** styling.
- **Product Display**: Displays product listings with images, descriptions, prices, and available quantities.
- **User Authentication**: Login, registration, and user profile management. 
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add/remove products to/from their cart and view a summary of selected items.
- **Checkout Process**: Integration of a secure checkout flow with an option for users to confirm shipping details and payment method.
- **Order History**: Registered users can view their previous orders and statuses.

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Node.js framework for building the server and API endpoints.
- **EJS Templating**: Dynamic rendering of HTML content using **EJS** templates.
- **Session Management**: **Express-session** used for managing user sessions, including user authentication, login states, and cart data.
- **Middleware**: Various middleware for handling authentication, logging, and security (e.g., CORS, helmet).
- **Product Management**: Admin functionality for adding, updating, and deleting products.
- **Cart & Order Management**: Allows users to add products to a cart, place orders, and track order statuses.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends confirmation emails upon order placement and shipping updates.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error-handling middleware for managing application errors.

### Database (MongoDB)
- **MongoDB Database**: Stores user data, products, orders, and shopping cart information.
- **Transactions**: Uses **MongoDB transactions** for handling order processing, ensuring data consistency (especially when processing payments and order confirmations).
- **Schemas**: Mongoose-based schemas for users, products, orders, reviews, and carts.
- **Indexes**: Indexed fields for improving query performance (e.g., searching products by category, name).
- **Data Validation**: Mongoose schema validation for ensuring valid data input from users.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **TypeScript**: Strongly-typed language for improved maintainability and scalability.
  - **Sass**: CSS preprocessor for modular, reusable, and maintainable styles.
  - **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.

- **Backend**:
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to handle routing, middleware, and API endpoints.
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing data about users, products, orders, etc.
  - **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB to model data and interact with the database.
  - **Express-session**: Manages user sessions for authentication and cart persistence.
  - **bcryptjs**: Used for hashing and verifying passwords securely.
  - **nodemailer**: For sending emails (e.g., order confirmation, shipping updates).
  
## Frontend

The frontend is responsible for the user interface and interactions, including the shopping experience, user authentication, and display of data fetched from the backend.

- **TypeScript** ensures type safety and prevents common JavaScript errors.
- **Sass** is used for modular, maintainable CSS with features like variables, nesting, and mixins.
- **EJS Templates**: Used to render dynamic HTML content on the frontend (e.g., product listings, order details).
- **State Management**: Uses local storage for managing shopping cart data, ensuring persistence across sessions.

### Key Frontend Features
- Product listings with filters for categories, price, and more.
- Login/Signup forms with client-side validation.
- User-friendly cart and checkout interface.
- Order history and status tracking.
- Error handling with user-friendly notifications.

## Backend

The backend serves as the API server and handles business logic, data management, user sessions, and security.

### Key Backend Features
- **Express.js** routing system to handle HTTP requests.
- **Session Management**: Using **express-session** for user authentication and storing user-related data like cart information.
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out. Passwords are hashed using **bcryptjs**.
- **Order Processing**: Uses **MongoDB transactions** to ensure consistency during order creation, stock updates, and payment processing.
- **Product Management**: Admin users can add, update, and delete products through the backend.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrates with **Stripe** or **PayPal** for secure payment processing.
- **Email Notifications**: **Nodemailer** sends email notifications upon successful order placement and shipping updates.

## Database

### MongoDB
- **MongoDB** stores the application data in a NoSQL format, making it highly flexible and scalable.
- **Mongoose** is used for defining models, interacting with the database, and validating input data.
  
### Transactions in MongoDB
- **Atomic Transactions**: MongoDB's support for multi-document transactions ensures that order-related operations (like inventory update, payment processing, and order creation) are handled atomically to prevent inconsistencies.
  
### MongoDB Collections
- **Users**: Stores user information (email, hashed password, shipping address, etc.).
- **Products**: Product data including name, price, description, and stock count.
- **Orders**: Stores orders, including user details, items purchased, and payment status.
- **Shopping Cart**: Stores the current cart data for logged-in users.
